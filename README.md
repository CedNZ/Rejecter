# Rejecter

A Year 7 Electronics class at Pakuranga Intermediate School set out to push their Inquiry learning to the next level. They set out to create their very own computer game complete with original graphics designed by them. 

With help from Cedric Bourneville, a Software Programming Student, studying at the University of Auckland, the students worked in teams for 4 weeks to come up with a concept that could be transformed into a live game. Their Game concept had to: 
Illustrate our topic; "Milk - From the Grass to the Shelf".
Be fun and engaging for 11 and 12 year olds.
Be of simple design and not to difficult to program.
Have high quality graphics drawn by hand.

They had to present their concept and game ideas complete with illustrations in front of the class to Cedric and their teacher Mr Clark. The one team or individual that had the best game concept would get their game idea bought to life by Cedric. 

Concept 
Iverson and Vern designed the winning concept. Their game idea was called 'The Rejecter". They got the idea for the game from a talk by an engineer from Fonterra - Jermin Tiu who shared with the class all the machines inside the milk factory. Iverson and Vern's favourite machine was of course the 'Milk Rejecter'. This machine measured the weight of each bottle and if a particular bottle was over or under filled, then a mechanical arm would fling out and hit the bottle off the conveyor belt and into a rubbish bin. Often milk would spill everywhere and it would make a mess.
